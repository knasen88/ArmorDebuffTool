## ArmorDebuffTool
Credit to kevmodrome aka Myakaa, I basically took his addon and with his blessing edited it to support armor debuffs. 
https://github.com/kevmodrome/SpellPowerMulti

Easily get an overview of current -armor debuffs on the target as well as a counter for the amount of armor reduced

The current version checks the following debuffs on target:
* Curse of Recklessness (CoR)
* Faeire Fire (FF)
* Annihilator weapon proc (armor shatter)
* Sunder armor 

The text will turn green when a debuff is active on the target. In the case of Sunder and armor shatter the text will be yellow if there are 1-4 or 1-2 stacks and green when there are 5 or 3 stacks.
